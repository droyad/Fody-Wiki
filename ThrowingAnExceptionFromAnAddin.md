When writing an addin there are a points to note when throwing an Exception.

 * Throwing an exception form an addin will be caught by Fody and interpreted as a build error. So this will stop the build.
 * The exception information will be logged to the MSBuild `BuildEngine.LogErrorEvent` method.
 * If the exception type is `WeavingException` then it will be interpreted as an "error". By this I mean that the addin is explicitly throwing an exception with the intent of stopping processing and logging a simple message to the build log. In this case the message logged will be the contents of `WeavingException.Message` property.
 * If the exception type is *not* `WeavingException` then it will be interpreted as an "unhandled exception". By this I mean something has gone seriously wrong with the addin. It most likely has a bug. In this case message logged be much bore verbose and will contain the full contents of the Exception. The code for getting the message can be found here in [ExceptionExtensions](https://github.com/SimonCropp/Fody/blob/master/FodyCommon/ExceptionExtensions.cs).
